## About The Project

NeoLang is an open-source programming language, made specifically for quick prototyping and new programmers. With that in mind it is built with an extremely simple syntax and a built-in compiler.

## Getting Started

To get started with using NeoLang, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

If you don't already have Python, install that by going to [python.org](https://python.org) and downloading the latest version of python.

To check if python is installed, run the following commands in the terminal.

##### On Windows

```sh
py --version
pip --version
```

##### On Mac/Linux

```sh
python3 --version
python3 -m pip --version
```

### Installation

To install NeoLang, use the Package Installer for Python by running the following commands.

##### On Windows

```sh
pip install neolang
```

##### On Mac/Linux

```sh
python3 -m pip install neolang
```

To check if NeoLang is installed, run the command `neo --version`. If this does not work, it's most likely because your Python installation has not been registered in your $PATH. To do so, i recommend following [this guide](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/add-python-to-path/).

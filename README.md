# NeoScript
NeoScript is an extremely simple scripting language built in Python, inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and [Skript](https://docs.skriptlang.org/). NeoScript is meant to be the 'step between Scratch and Python', originally made to help my friends learn programming, which with the easy-to-learn-and-read syntax would be way easier.
